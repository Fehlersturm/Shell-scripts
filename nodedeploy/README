This is probably very specific and not of use to most people.

it clones the gitrepository at $GITROOT/$1 and checks for a file $1/dependencies.

this file contains one dependency per line. The first word is the name, everything else is description.

there is a casestatment with every dependency this script knows. if a dependency is found it tries to install. if not it prompts the user to install himself.

next the script adds init.d scripts. logfiles. logrotation.
