A way to distribute shellscripts which are executed by root.
they need to reside here: /home/sysmaint on the server from where they are downloaded
the downloading servers must have gpg and the Keys with uid INC Recipient installed.
the file sysmaint.sh is encrypted like so: gpg -e -s -u PUBKEYFINGERPRINT -o new_sysmaint.sh.gpg sysmaint.sh
the key PRIVKEY is to be stored on a offline machine 
the file /home/sysmaint/newversion holds the versionnumber. if this is increased all machines will download new.sysmaint.sh and will try to decrypt and execute it.
one cannot target single machines who downloads but one can filter inside the script eg ask etc/hostname and only execute on a specific host / group of hosts...

Setup:
Server:
store contents of folder sysmaint on some server which wants to be the control machine
adjust all variables like sysmaint_user and workdir updateserver etc in the script dlupdate.sh
store the 2 keys needed for decryption there too update their names in setupsysmaintroot.sh

Client:
become root
create a sysmaint user
make a keypair and send pubkey to server
get the setupsysmaintroot.sh e.g like this: scp -o IdentityFile=/home/sysmaint/.ssh/id_rsa sysmaint@\[IPV6\]:/home/sysmaint/setupsysmaintroot .
chmod +x and execute it
done.
